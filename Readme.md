## Requirements
- python 3.7.0
- pytorch 1.10.0
- pytorch-lightning 1.2.5
- torchvision 0.11.0
- pytorch-lightning==1.2.5

For more details, please refer to the `requirements.txt`. We conduct the experiments with 8 NVIDIA 3090Ti GPUs.

Put the first stage [model](https://cloud.tsinghua.edu.cn/f/7eb11fc208144ed0ad20/?dl=1) to `./models`.

## Dataset
Please download the HDTF dataset for training and test, and process the dataset as following.

**Data Preprocessing:** 


1. Set all videos to 25 fps.
2. Extract the audio signals and facial landmarks. 
3. Put the processed data in `./data/HDTF`, and construct the data directory as following.
4. Constract the `data_train.txt` and `data_test.txt` as following.

./data/HDTF:

    |——data/HDTF
       |——images
          |——0_0.jpg
          |——0_1.jpg
          |——...
          |——N_M.bin
       |——landmarks
          |——0_0.lms
          |——0_1.lms
          |——...
          |——N_M.lms
       |——audio_smooth
          |——0_0.npy
          |——0_1.npy
          |——...
          |——N_M.npy

./data/data_train(test).txt:

    0_0
    0_1
    0_2
    ...
    N_M


N is the total number of classes, and M is the class size.

<!-- new information start -->
run preprocessing as following
python3 scripts/preprocess.py /mnt/hard3/rhs/intern/ops/sample*.webm
<!-- new information end -->



## Training
```
sh run.sh
```

## Test
```
sh inference.sh
```
## Weakness
1. The DiffTalk models talking head generation as an iterative denoising process, which needs more time to synthesize a frame compared with most GAN-based approaches. This is also a common problem of LDM-based works.
2. The model is trained on the HDTF dataset, and it sometimes fails on some identities from other datasets. 
3. When driving a portrait with more challenging cross-identity audio, the audio-lip synchronization of the synthesized video is slightly inferior to the ones under self-driven setting.
4. During inference, the network is also sensitive to the mask shape in z_T , where the mask needs to cover the mouth region completely and its shape cannot leak any
lip shape information.
